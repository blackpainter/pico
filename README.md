Practical ICO - Customized and transparent ICO procedure

# Inspiration
ICOs have usually played a questioned role in cryptoeconomic, for whitepapers are not easy to understand by ordinary investors, both technically and economically, and once done, technically there is no restrain for the already profited team. As a result, both investors and honest teams were harmed by some bad examples.

Bancor protocol is a well-known asynchronous price discovery mechanism, also offers a good practice for creating tokens based on one or more connector token(s), the later provides reserved value for the new tokens, and for a given connector weight, the curve of a token’s price could be predicable and transparent to end users.

Our idea is that ICO should be a procedure, which takes a period of time, and Bancor’s connector weight factor could be involved all along the procedure of initialization of tokens, and other factors could also be considered, once the parameters of the process been settled, the potential profit of the team would be visible to investors. We are aiming to construct a bridge of trust.

#What it does
We add a TF(team funding) factor to the original pricing formula of bancor. TF is a function defined by the team, probably but not necessarily taking parameters like funding time/token issued(destroyed)/connector token paid(returned) etc.

This TF factor is added for the sake of teams’ continuity, for reasonable need or profit but not avarice. It will be designed by the team out of its own consideration, and once the extended bancor contract is deployed, it would demonstrate the predicted curves of both buying and selling, give investors a clear idea how much contribution they will make and how they could profit from the early involving, help to make decisions.
