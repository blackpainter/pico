Practical ICO - Customized and transparent ICO procedure

# Inspiration
ICOs have usually played a questioned role in cryptoeconomic, for whitepapers are not being easy to understand by ordinary investors, both technically and economically, and once done, technically there is no restrain for the already profited team. As a result, both investors and honest teams were harmed by some bad examples.

Bancor protocol is a well-known asynchronous price discovery mechanism, also offers a good practice for creating tokens based on one or more connector token(s), the later provides reserved value for the new tokens, and for a given connector weight, the curve of a token’s price could be predicable and transparent to end users.

Our idea is that ICO should be a procedure, which takes a period of time, and Bancor’s connector weight factor could be involved all along the procedure of initialization of tokens, and other factors could also be considered, once the parameters of the process been settled, the potential profit of the team would be visible to investors. We are aiming to construct a bridge of trust.
